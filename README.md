# MyoArcade
Our team is focussing on developing a system to gamify the muscle rehabilitation experience. Our created system has 3 main domains:
- Diagnostic Capability
- Targeted Physiotherapy
- Tracking Rehabilitation

## Diagnostic Capability
Using the Myo sensor - we are able to investigate the activity of specific nerves and changes to neuronal activity after injury. The main target for our system is stroke patients, and young children with muscular dystrophy.
